This is a Tic Tac Toe game! yYou can log in, save games, and track you win/losses. It's fairly simple and is my very first project!

List unsolved problems

My requests run 4 times, each time 3 succeed and 1 fails. It still works and things do exactly what they should. You just also get errors in the console. The 1 that fails appends the url twice instead of once. I do not know why after hours of looking it over.
